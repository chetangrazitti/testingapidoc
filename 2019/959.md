## When the September "Searches With No Results" report was ran, it captured 497 searches with no results. I went back to custom change the date and the number is now at 561. Can you please advise on why this number would change?

## Solution
At the end of each calendar month, your analytics data undergoes indexing. Indexing is time-consuming process, taking up to 7 days. And while it's underway, the reports data in Analytics updates several times. If your instance has not been updated to Mamba '20 or a later version, kindly wait for at least a week before downloading accurate reports.
