We have successfully deployed the Page Rating custom component through our pre-production tiers to our QA sandbox support communities. We've gotten two pieces of feedback on the design: The Yes button is wider than the No button. How can I make them the same size? The buttons also are currently side-by-side with no space between them. How can I add a little space?

## Environment

Variable | Details
--- | ---
SearchUnify Version | MYSTERY
SearchUnify Module | Page Rating in Search Clients
Customer Platform | Salesforce Communities

## Solution
Unlike search clients, which have their own HTML and CSS editor in Designer, Page Rating cannot be tinkered with from the admin panel. To alter button size and to insert a space between "Yes" and "No", kindly write to your customer success manager (CSM) or log a ticket on the community.
