Lets say you want to replace the rank 3 article. You delete the boosting on the old article. The new article still can't have rank 3. There is an error message that rank 3 already exists (even though you deleted it).

## Solution
Kindly update your SearchUnify instance to Mamba '20 or a later version. It was a bug in versions Colubridae 19 and older, and it has been fixed. Now whenver your remove an article from your content source, its index value is freed; enabling you to assign the value to another article.
