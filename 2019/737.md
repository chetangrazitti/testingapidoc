# I am trying to set up KCS Support Console in a sandbox instance with Colubridae. When I add our Salesforce Knowledge Base object, I do not see any fields available to drag (see screenshot). Am I missing a step?

## Environment
Variable | Details
--- | ---
SearchUnify Version | Colubridae XX
SearchUnify Module | Search Client
Customer Platform | Salesforce Lightning
Type | Lightning

## Solution
The person who authorized SearchUnify to index your org is not a Knowledge User. Turning them into a Knowledge User will solve the issue.

Being a Salesforce Admin and Salesforce Knowledge User are separate things. An Admin can authorize search crawls, but cannot set up KCS Support Console if they are not Knowledge Users.

To become a Knowledge User

1. Find **Knowledge Settings** from **Quick Find Box** and click **Edit.** ![Knowledge Settings and Edit](https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Resources-Mamba20/Images/SearchClients/salesforce-console/3.png)
2. Check **Enable Lightning Knowledge** and click **Save**. ![Enable Lightning Knowledge](https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Resources-Mamba20/Images/SearchClients/salesforce-console/4.png)
