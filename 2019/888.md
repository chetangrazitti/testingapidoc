I just noticed that the order of words in a search affects search results. "keyword1 keyword2" fetches different results from "keyword2 keyword1" I don't understand why this is happening. It doesn't seem like expected behavior for a search engine. Are you planning on changing the search behavior to ignore the order of words?

## Solution 
This is the expected behavior, and you can spot this behavior on all major search providers. There is a huge difference between "John kicked Mary." and "Mary kicked John." Relevancy can take a hit if we turn off word order.
