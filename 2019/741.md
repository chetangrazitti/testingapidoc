## In an effort to better understand our customer journeys and search habits, and help them refine their searches, we need to be able to identify and contact them via email. We are requesting the ability to identify users in the following reports: Searches With No Result and Searches With No Click.

## Solution
An addon in the SearchUnify app store enables you to map search session IDs with emails. The addon is called Email Tracking. Once it has been installed on your instance, you can identify users in **Searches With No Result**, **Searches With No Click**, and other reports in Search Analytics.

To install the addon,

1. Log into your SearchUnify instances.
2. Navigate to **Addons**.
3. Click **Add New SearchUnify Addon**.
4. Click **Install** to download Email Tracking.

### IMPORTANT.
Email Tracking is disabled to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We recommend turning it on if you have your customers' or search client users' explicit consent to collect their data.
