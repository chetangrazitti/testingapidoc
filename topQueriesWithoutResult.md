# Issue: Queries with Vertical Line (|)
I keep on seeing a lot of queries with a vertical line. What could be wrong?

## Context
A lot of the users are developers.

## Resolution
Nothing is wrong. It means that some of your search client users know how advanced search works in general. The vertical line (|) is a Boolean operator. Its value is OR. It is used to run advanced search queries. 

```salesforce | sfdc``` 

It probably means someone is using assembling search queries using regular expressions.
