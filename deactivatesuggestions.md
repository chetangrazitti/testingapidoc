# Issue: Turn Off Search Suggestions
Is there a way to turn off search suggestions on a search client. We want users to think for themselves instead of relying on the hive.

## Resolution
You can mute search suggestions for a set of queries. This article walks you through the process. 

1. Log into your instance.
2. Go to NLP Manager > Suggestions Removal.
3. From the Configure Suggestion dropdown, select a search client.
4. Click Add Text.
5. Enter a search query and click Submit.

Search suggestions will be deactivated for the query on the selected search client.

### Important

* You cannot mute search suggestions for all search queries.
* Stemming is not supported. Add all the inflections of a query in uppercase, lowercase, and camel case to completely deactivate suggestions.
